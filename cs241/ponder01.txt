Your Name:

1. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?

I learned how to connect to a Linux server via SSH in VS Code.


2. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.

I helped my wife this afternoon with a call she made to our electricity provider to sort out why they were scamming us. (As is turns out, a technical error on their end had turned on auto-pay, but not from any particular account, and so racked up unpaid payments but didn't notify anyone, not us or the provider.) 
I also asked her to go through and test all my code for me. She did an amazing job of finding bugs and spelling errors.


3. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?

I feel that I understand all the topics from this week, but I feel like my python skills are still a bit rusty


4. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:

Reading - 3 hour
Checkpoint A - 10 min
Checkpoint B - 15 min
Prove Assignment - 1.5 hour
